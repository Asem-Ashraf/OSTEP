# OSTEP

This repository holds a number of projects that can be used in an operating systems class aimed at upper-level undergraduates and (in some cases) beginning graduate students. They are based on years of teaching such a course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

It contains the projects that I have done from the course.

In the hope to do all of them...
